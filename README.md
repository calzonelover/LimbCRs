# Hi there
Indirect measurement CRs spectrum from gamma-ray spectrum which measured by Fermi LAT
# Process of this work
* Extract Limb's gamma-ray flux data from 'finaltree.root' and exposuremap by 'PerfecrFlux.py'
* Find error of parameter by using Monte Carlo simulation : 'ErrorStat.py' , 'ErrorTotal.py'
