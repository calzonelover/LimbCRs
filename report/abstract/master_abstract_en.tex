% Cosmic rays (CRs) are high-energy particles propagating in space. It is mainly constituted by protons and the rigidity spectrum is well described by a power law. Recent
% measurements by PAMELA and AMS-02 indicate an abrupt change of the CR proton
% spectral index at about 336 GV. When protons interact with the Earthâ€™s upper atmosphere, $\gamma$-rays can be produced and detected by space-based detectors. The
% Earth Limb $\gamma$-ray data was collected by the {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) along with
% proton-air interaction models to determine the CR proton spectral indices that best fit
% the $\gamma$-ray data.

Cosmic rays (CRs) are high-energy particles, mostly protons, propagating in space. The rigidity (momentum per charge) spectrum of CRs is well described by a power law for which the spectral index is approximately 2.8 around 30 - 1000 GV. Recent measurements by PAMELA and AMS-02 indicate an abrupt change of the CR proton spectral index at about 340 GV. When CRs interact with the Earth's upper atmosphere, $\gamma$ rays can be produced and detected by space-based detectors. Here we use the Earth's $\gamma$-ray data collected by the {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope along with a proton-air interaction model to indirectly determine the CR proton spectral index and compare against observations by other instruments.
