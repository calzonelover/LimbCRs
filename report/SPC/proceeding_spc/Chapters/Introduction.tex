Cosmic rays (CRs) are high energy particles which are produced in space by various types
of acceleration mechanisms such as supernovae, active galactic nuclei, quasars, and
gamma-ray bursts. The main composition of CRs consist of 90\% protons, 8\% alpha
and other heavier atoms.
The widely accepted explanation of why CR spectrum follows a power-law function in rigidity is that the acceleration mechanism was modeled as a diffusive shock which has a characteristic spectral index.
