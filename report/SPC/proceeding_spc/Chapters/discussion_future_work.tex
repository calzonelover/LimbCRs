The best-fit BPL model of CR proton from this work are consistent with direct
measurements as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:proton-flux}.
We will need to determine whether the BPL model fits the data significantly better
than the SPL model does using likelihood ratio test to quantify the level of
confidence. We also plan to determine the statistical and total uncertainties of
the fit results by performing Monte Carlo simulations. 

% From Figure~\ref{fig:gamma-flux}, a trend of incident proton model
% demonstrated that BPL has more consistency than SPL. Nevertheless,
% to determine the significance between two models require likelihood
% ratio test to evaluate the statistical level of confidence. In addition,
% statistical and total error including the instrument will be determined
% by performing Monte Carlo Simulation.
