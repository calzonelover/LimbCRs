From the figure \ref{fig:gamma-flux}, a trend of incident proton model
demonstrated that BPL has more consistency than SPL. Nevertheless,
to determine the significance between two models require likelihood
ratio test to evaluate the statistical level of confidence. In addition,
statistical and total error including the instrument will be determined
by performing Monte Carlo Simulation.
