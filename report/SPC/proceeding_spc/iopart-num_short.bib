  abstract={The energy spectra of galactic cosmic rays carry fundamental information regarding their origin and propagation. These spectra, when measured near Earth, are significantly affected by the solar magnetic field. A comprehensive description of the cosmic radiation must therefore include the transport and modulation of cosmic rays inside the heliosphere. During the end of the last decade, the Sun underwent a peculiarly long quiet phase well suited to study modulation processes. In this paper we present proton spectra measured from 2006 July to 2009 December by PAMELA. The large collected statistics of protons allowed the time variation to be followed on a nearly monthly basis down to 400 MV. Data are compared with a state-of-the-art three-dimensional model of solar modulation.}

	journal = {Proceedings of the Physical Society},
	abstract = {Extensive air showers in the size range N = 3 × 105 to 4 × 106 have been studied with an array of four water tanks, in which the shower particles are detected by the Cerenkov light they produce when passing through the water. It is found that the differential size spectrum of the showers has a rapid change of slope in the neighbourhood of N = 6 × 105, the exponent changing from 2.3 ± 0.1 to 3.0 ± 0.15 with increasing N.
The cascade multiplication or attenuation of the number of particles as they pass through the depth of water in the tanks is reflected in the amount of Cerenkov light produced, and from this effect an estimate has been made of the effective exponent s of the shower particle integral energy spectrum E-s. The values found for s range from s = 0.58 ± 0.06 for distances less than 3 metres from the shower axis to s = 1.7 ± 0.3 for distances greater than 30 metres.}

	title = {Energy spectrum and mass composition of high-energy cosmic rays},
	journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
	abstract = {Primary cosmic rays above energies of about 100 TeV are investigated by observations of extensive air showers (EAS) using large area ground based detector installations for registering various components of the EAS cascade development. By such indirect studies of the primary cosmic rays a steepening of the power-law spectrum at around 3–5 PeV, known as the knee, has been identified. At higher energies around 5 EeV there appears a further change of the spectral index towards a flattening of the spectrum, called the ankle. The energy region above ca 50 EeV, where a cut-off of the cosmic ray spectrum (Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuz'min (GZK) cut-off) is theoretically predicted, is of particular current interest and provides an astrophysical enigma, since obviously trans-GZK events have been observed. Any explanation of these features of the cosmic ray spectrum needs sufficiently detailed knowledge of the shape of the spectrum and of the variation of the mass composition of cosmic rays. In this paper different experimental approaches deducing mass and energy sensitive information from the EAS experiments and their results are discussed. The experiments involve measurements of secondary particle distributions at various observation levels and of muons by deep underground detectors, as well as measurements of air Cherenkov light and, in particular at higher energies, of air fluorescence light emitted during the EAS development. Recently, methods for analysing multi-dimensional EAS parameter distributions have been favoured. They take into account correlations of different EAS parameters and, in particular by non-parametric techniques, also the influence of the intrinsic fluctuation of the air shower development. This paper illustrates the application of such methods in a coherent view of recent results. The advanced analysing methods are corroborated by hybrid experimental set-ups registering a larger set of different EAS observables simultaneously in an event-by-event mode. In addition such approaches provide the possibility to test the consistency of the hadronic interaction models and Monte Carlo procedures used as reference for the analyses. The physical and astrophysical implications of the current findings in various energy regions are briefly discussed and prospects of future experiments are presented.}

abstract="The existing paradigm of the origin of Galactic cosmic rays places strong supernovae shocks as the acceleration site for this material. However, although the EGRET gamma-ray telescope has reported evidence for GeV gamma rays from some supernovae, it is still unclear if the signal is produced by locally intense cosmic rays. Although non-thermal X-ray emissions have been detected from supernova remnants and interpreted as synchrotron emission from locally intense electrons at energies up to âŒ100Â TeV, the inferred source energy spectral slopes seem much steeper than the electron source spectrum observed through direct measurements. It remains the case that simple energetics provide the most convincing argument that supernovae power the bulk of cosmic rays. Two characteristics which can be used to investigate this issue at high energy are the source energy spectra and the source composition derived from direct measurements.",
