Cosmic rays (CRs) are high-energy particles propagating in space. They are mainly constituted by protons and the energy spectrum is well described by a power law.
Recent measurements by PAMELA and AMS-02 indicate an abrupt change of the CR proton spectral index at about 300 GeV.
When protons interact with the Earth's upper atmosphere, $\gamma$-rays can be produced and detected by space-based detectors. We use the Earth Limb $\gamma$-ray data collected by the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) along with proton-air interaction models to determine the CR proton spectral indices that best fit the $\gamma$-ray data.

I would like to thanks to Dr. Warit Mitthumsiri and Dr. Francesca Spada for their advise and any other supervision.

\par To begin with project I also appreciate Mr. Suttiwat Madlee for any recommendation and revise my program knowledge.
This work also be fulfill the improvement in terms of theory and instrument correction by Prof. Luca Baldini, Dr. Carmelo Sgrò, Mr. Niccolò Di Lalla, Mr. Alberto Manfreda, as well as to people in the Space Physics laboratory at Mahidol University and the Fermi lab at the University of Pisa. 

Last but not least, I would like to to thanks Development and Promotion of Science and Technology Talents Project (DPST) for any finalcial support since I was starting this work. This work was partially supported by the Thailand Research Fund award RTA5980003.
