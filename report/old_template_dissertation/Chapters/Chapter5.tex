\lhead{Conclusion}

The result of this work put weight on the previous study \cite{previouswork} that we could take a benefit of brightness $\gamma$-ray from Earth's high atmosphere to indirectly observe cosmic ray spectrum which cause this luminous. 
In this study, we perform an indirect measurement with a newest \acs{Fermi-LAT}'s reconstruction event (Pass8) with the same model and modify Helium spectrum by using AMS-02 instead of PAMELA due to it has more precise proton spectrum. To sum up, we found that there is an energy break point around 328 GeV with a significant level of 3.3$\sigma$ which agree with other direct measurement.
Even though we have found better of BPL than SPL, but we still need the significant more than 5$\sigma$ to strongly comfirm a drastic change of proton spectrum in order of hundren GeV which would be the future work.
