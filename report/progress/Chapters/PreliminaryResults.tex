\subsubsection*{Count map and distribution}

First step to check whether data that have in our hand is makes some sense or not is to simply plot the distribution of photon from a picked single weekly photon file 
as in Fig \ref{fig:exphotondist}. Another step is to see the histogram of photon over energy as \ref{fig:photoncounthist}.

    \label{fig:photoncounthist}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Exposure maps}

This step require a lot of effort to make it robust and many of testing has been performed from
the serial to parallel code along the way of development.
To overview some of the exposure map, the selected four out of fifty exposure map has shown in the Fig (\ref{fig:expmapscart}, \ref{fig:expmapspolar}) in cartesian and polar plot sequentially.

\end{figure}

% \subsubsection*{Differential Flux of $\gamma$-ray}

% Lastly, preliminary of gamma-ray spectrum has been computed and show in Fig \ref{fig:gammarayfluxnew}.

\subsubsection*{Best-fit parameters}
The optimized paramters has been shown in Table (\ref{tb:bestfit}).

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l | c | c | c}
      Best fits & $\gamma_1$ & $\gamma_2$ & $E_{\text{Break}}$ (GeV) \\
      \hline \hline
      SPL & 2.70 & - & -  \\
      BPL & 2.86  & 2.63 & 333
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Optimization results}
    \label{tb:bestfit}
\end{table}

Applying the best-fit parameters to the interaction model could yield a comparative results
to the measured $\gamma$-ray spectrum in the Figure (\ref{fig:bestfittedgamma}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/fitted_result.pdf}
    \caption{
        The $\gamma$-ray spectra calculated from the SPL (blue) and BPL (green) models of CR proton
        which best fit with the measured Earthâ€™s $\gamma$-ray spectrum in the thin-target regime
        (red)
    }
    \label{fig:bestfittedgamma}
\end{figure}

Last but not least, a striagt-forward way to roughly validate the result is to visualize
an indirected proton spectrum with multiple direct measurement from other instruments as in 
the Figure (\ref{fig:bestfittedproton}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/ProtonSpectrumModelMeasurement}
    \caption{Best-fit CR proton spectrum from this work (red) compared to the measurements
    by AMS-02 (blue) and PAMELA (green)}
    \label{fig:bestfittedproton}
\end{figure}

By applying Wilk's theorem, we could treat the log-likelihood ratio 
as a score from chi-square distribution from 2 degree of freedoms
to find p-value which is around 0.92.
From doing so, this value could be converted to the Z-score
in normal distribution and the result has shown that the
value is around 1.38 $\sigma$. It's quite disappoint that the 
significant level from the indirect measurement is not so high.
The reason could be either from the constrain from the optimization
does not cover the global minimum of the problem or the 
result from the new measurement literally tells the limitation of
an indirect measurement or the breaking point does not clear that it's exists from this study.

\subsubsection*{Statistical significant}

The significant level could be determined by using 
central limit theorem (CLT) to test one-tail hypothesis 
from the null hypothesis comparing to alternative hypothesis
which is the breaking of spectral indices and non-breaking scheme.
The significant is around 1.38 $\sigma$ or at 92\%.
