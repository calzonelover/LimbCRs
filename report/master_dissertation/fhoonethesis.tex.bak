\maketitle \acknowledgements{\linespacing{1.4}First of all, I would
like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to my advisor
Professor Dr.\ David Ruffolo. You have been a tremendous mentor for
me. I would like to thank you for encouraging my research and for
allowing me to grow as a research physicist. During my graduate
study, you were always there to provide necessary assistance and
academic resources. Your advice on both research as well as on my
career have been priceless. I profusely thank Professor Dr.\ Paul
Evenson who was my international co-advisor, and a father-like
figure to me. You were always eager to help, be it a research issue
or taking care of me when I visited the University of Delaware, USA
for eight months. I would also like to thank my committee members,
Dr.\ Alejandro S\'aiz and Dr.\ Kittiwit Matan for taking the time
serve as my committee members. I also want to thank you for letting
my progress reports and defense be invaluable moments, and for your
brilliant comments and suggestions, thanks to you.

I would like to especially thank Dr.\ Achara Seripienlert who is the
best friend I have ever come across. I admire your positive
attitude. The best feature of your unique character is being a great
listener. You were always there to listen and to give me sincere
advice about anything I hoped for. Much help during the work was
provided by many people. I would like to thank Mr.\ Wirin Sonsretee,
Dr.\ Kittipat Malakit, Dr.\ Pierre-Simon Mangeard and Dr.\ Warit
Mitthumsiri in the Space Physics and Energetic Particles Lab for
discussions %and suggestions
about physics knowledge. All of you
encouraged holding group workshops to promote and encourage learning
for me.

I would like to thank my wonderful friends, Miss Wanna Wirojdanthai,
Miss Porntip Terdbaramee and Miss Kanitta Onsiri from Chandrakasem
Rajabhat University. You are always at my side when I feel tired,
discouraged and despondent, so thanks to all of you. I would also
like to thank Asst. Prof. Rawin Chaisittiporn who supported and
suggested me in programming, and spurred me to strive towards my
goal.

I would like to thank my family. Words cannot express how grateful I
am to my mother, my father and two younger brothers for all of the
sacrifices that you have made on my behalf. Your prayer for me was
what sustained me thus far.

Finally, I am grateful to the Royal Golden Jubilee fellowship
PHD/0136/2552, the Thailand Research Fund for supporting my
funding.}

\abstract{\setlength{\parindent}{2cm} Neutron monitors are large
ground-based detectors that provide accurate measurements of
variations in the cosmic ray flux from space. At any given location,
the magnetic field of the Earth blocks particles below a
well-defined rigidity (momentum per unit charge) known as the cutoff
rigidity. By carrying a neutron monitor to different locations, the
Earth served as a magnet spectrometer. This work explores two topics
concerning portable neutron monitors. The first topic is to filter
bad data from a calibration neutron monitor (``calmon'') at Doi
Inthanon. It was used to calibrate the Princess Sirindhorn Neutron
Monitor (PSNM), which is particularly important because this has the
world's highest cutoff rigidity for a fixed station. From the raw
data, we have extracted the calmon/PSNM count rate ratio as a
function of the calmon location and environment. Another topic is to
analyze data from a ship-borne neutron monitor. The Galactic cosmic
ray spectrum exhibits subtle variations over the 22-year solar
magnetic cycle in addition to the more dramatic variations over the
11-year sunspot cycle. By repeating ship-borne latitude surveys with
identical equipment, a sensitive measurement of changes in the
spectrum can be made. Here we analyze data from the 1994 through
2007 series of latitude surveys conducted by the Bartol Research
Institute, the University of Tasmania, and the Australian Antarctic
Division. We show that the curious ``crossover'' in spectra measured
near sunspot minima during epochs of opposite solar magnetic
polarity is related directly to a sudden change in the behavior of
solar modulation at the time of the polarity reversal. We suggest
that the crossover itself results from the interaction of effects
due to gradient/curvature drifts with a systematic change in the
interplanetary diffusion coefficient caused by turbulent magnetic
helicity.}
