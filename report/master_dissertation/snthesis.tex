\abstract{Solar neutrons are produced from high energy processes in
solar flares. The phenomena associated with solar neutrons include
soft X-ray emission, hard X-ray emission and $\gamma$-ray emission.
The solar neutrons can be observed by ground-based detectors. When
cosmic rays collide with the Earth's atmosphere to produce a shower
or cascade of secondary particles, ground-based neutron monitors can
detect the secondary neutrons from the shower. The increased count
rate of a neutron monitor due to solar neutrons occurs over such a
short time duration that the fluctuations of  background galactic
cosmic rays might produce a signal like this.

Statistical methods are needed to decide whether or not an increased
count rate in a neutron monitor is a signal from solar neutrons. This
statistical test features an automated determination of an optimum
background interval with the background determined both before and
after the signal period. The statistical method used to evaluate the
detection of solar neutrons at the 95\% confidence level at the
Tsumeb neutron monitor station in southern Africa has not found
false alarms during October, 2003. The signal found from this
station on October 28, 2003 is generally recognized as a true signal.
However, if the results from the statistical method were to have
false positives, that might occur from the increase in count rate
from statistical fluctuations, solar energetic ions, or Forbush
decrease recoveries, which we aim to eliminate with our statistical
test.}

\chapter{Introduction}
\hspace{40pt} The Earth's atmosphere is continually hit by high
energy particles from outer space called cosmic rays. Most of the
cosmic rays are protons, i.e., hydrogen ions. An importance source
of cosmic rays in the solar system is solar storms.

\section{Solar storms}
\hspace{40pt} Solar storms include solar flares and coronal mass
ejections, CMEs. These are explosions at the surface of the Sun
where the magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere
is suddenly released. The energetic particles from the Sun, due to
solar storms, are called \emph{Solar Energetic Particles} or SEP for
short.

Solar flares are observed by using filters to isolate the light
emitted by hydrogen atoms in the red region of the solar spectrum
(the H$\alpha$ spectral line). Coordinated worldwide observations
continuously monitor the Sun by using optical telescopes with
H$\alpha$ filters, capturing images of the Sun every few seconds.

Solar flares appear as a sudden brightening, lasting from a few
minutes to an hour, usually in active regions with strong, complex
magnetic fields. The H$\alpha$ observations describe the shape,
size, location and intensity of solar flares in the chromosphere.
This leads to one flare classification based on their extent and
brightness in H$\alpha$ (Table \ref{table:1}). Their size is
referred to as their importance and is expressed as their area in
units of $10^{-6}$ of the Sun's disk area. Their intensity is
measured by brilliance in visible radiation and labeled as F
(faint), N (normal) or B (brilliant).

There are two types of solar flares, impulsive and gradual flares.
The impulsive flares release soft X-rays over a short time duration
and emit solar energetic particles (SEP) to interplanetary space.

The gradual flares also emit mass in a CME, which drives a shock
that can accelerate particles to high energy. CMEs are detected
during routine visible light observations of the corona (blocking
light from the solar disk) from spacecraft such the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO.

Solar energetic particles can be observed by ground based detectors
such neutron monitors. This detector monitors the intensity of
cosmic rays over time. In some cases there is an abrupt increase in the
count rate after a solar flare event.

\section{Neutron monitor network}
\hspace{40pt} When energetic cosmic rays collide with the Earth's
atmosphere, they produce nuclear cascades of secondary cosmic ray
particles including protons, neutrons, charged and neutral pions,
electrons, muons and photons (Figure \ref{fig:cascade}). These
particles can be observed by ground-based detectors such as muon
detectors, neutron telescopes, and neutron monitors. By monitoring
cosmic rays, we notice increases or decreases of intensity of cosmic
rays at ground level. The changes occur for various reasons that
effect our lives and technology. High energy charged particles from
solar storms can destroy electronic devices of satellites. The
number of ions in the ionosphere increase when had a solar storm
that effect to radio communication. Therefore, interactions between
charged particles and atmospheric ions of nitrogen and oxygen
produce colorful light called aurora at the northern and southern
polar regions.

A neutron monitor is a type of equipment to detect neutrons from
secondary cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere. These particles
fall in the energy range of a few hundred MeV up to about one GeV.
The neutron monitor was initially developed by Simpson. There are
two designs of neutron monitors. The first is called the IGY
(International Geophysical Year in 1956/1957) design and later the
larger NM64 monitor was designed by Carmichael in 1964.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{cascade.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{The nuclear cascade in the Earth's atmosphere when the
cosmic ray collide with the air molecule.}\label{fig:cascade}
\end{figure}

The main components of a neutron monitor are proportional counter
tubes filled with $^{10}$BF$_{3}$ gas, lead, and paraffin or
polyethylene in the IGY or NM64 design, respectively. The paraffin
or polyethylene is used as a reflector to reflect away low energy
neutrons from the environment and also as a moderator to slow down
the high energy neutrons, so they are more readily detected in the
proportional counters. The lead is used as a neutron producer. An
energetic atmospheric neutron undergoes nuclear interactions in the
lead that produce $\sim 5$ daughter neutrons that increase the count
rate. Finally, in a proportional counter, a neutron is captured by a
$^{10}$B nucleus by the reaction, $^{10}$B + $n$ $\rightarrow$
$^{7}$Li + $\alpha$, and the cross-section of the reaction follows a
$1/v$ dependence, where $v$ is the neutron velocity. The detection
is made in terms of the charged alpha particles and lithium nuclei,
which deposit energy and are detected in the counter. High voltage
(2.8 kV) is supplied to the counter, which allows detection of a
pulse with a time width of 20 $\mu$s.

Nowadays there are several neutron monitor stations located at many
places around the world, but each station has differences in
geomagnetic cutoff rigidity and altitude. The cutoff rigidity is the
minimum momentum per charge for which charged cosmic rays can reach
the atmosphere above that station. Because the atmospheric secondary
neutrons are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, their intensity is
determined by the atmospheric depth. This is the distance multiplied by
the density, integrated over the height of the atmosphere, in units
of g cm$^{-2}$. A neutron monitor station located at high altitude
has a higher count rate than a station at lower altitude.

Almost every count seen in a neutron monitor is due to galactic
cosmic rays. This type of cosmic rays comes from sources outside our
solar system. Normally, the number of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) is almost constant, but
when the Sun has a solar storm such as a solar flare or CME, we
occasionally find increases in count rate due to charged SEP at
polar monitors that have a low cutoff rigidity. Such events are
called ground level enhancements (GLEs). Actually, solar neutrons
are rarely detected, and most events of solar neutrons were observed
by equatorial monitors. Here, we develop a statistical test for
checking whether the signal seen in a neutron monitor is caused by
solar neutrons or not.

\section{Motivation}
\hspace{40pt} A posteriori statistics are statistics that defined
after an event is observed. Such statistics are suspected to involve
substantial human bias, so we aim to develop a priori statistics,
which are statistics that are defined before an event is observed,
in advance of the installation of the Princess Sirindhorn Neutron
Monitor at Doi Inthanon in Thailand. This is the first time that a
priori statistics are devised for evaluating solar neutron events.
Solar neutrons are rarely detected and typically give a weak signal,
so a statistical method is important for deciding whether or not the
increase in neutron monitors due to solar neutrons. It is important
to study solar neutrons so that we can learn more about nuclear
interactions at the Sun.

The Princess Sirindhorn Neutron Moniter (PSNM) is planned to be
located at Doi Inthanon in Thailand, which has an altitude of 2565
meters above sea level and would have the highest vertical cutoff
rigidity, 16.8 GV, of any neutron monitor in the world \cite{PSNM}.

\section{Objectives of study}
\hspace{40pt}
The purpose of this research is to find an a priori
procedure for evaluating whether solar neutrons have been detected,
providing either an upper limit on the solar neutron count rate, an
estimate of the solar neutron count rate, or a solar neutron time profile
either for a general time or a specific solar event time.

\chapter{Phenomena Associated with Solar Neutron Events}
\hspace{40pt}
When solar neutrons are observed, there are some
phenomena related to the production of solar neutrons that are
usually found along with before the observation of the solar
neutrons.

\section{Solar neutron flares}
\hspace{40pt} Solar flares have mechanisms, which are not fully
understood, to accelerate particles to high energy. The physical
interactions of these particles in the solar atmosphere (e.g., the
photosphere) produce some of the $\gamma$-rays and all of the
neutrons. Neutrons can be produced with energies extending from
about 1 MeV to several GeV \cite{Chupp1987}.

The solar neutrons are mostly produced by $p$-$p$, $p$-$\alpha$,
$\alpha$-$p$ and $\alpha$-$\alpha$ reactions \cite{Murphy1987}. The
cross-section for the inelastic $p$-$p$ interaction for neutron
production has an effective threshold of about 300 MeV in the fixed
frame. The $p$-$p$ interactions are the most important for the
production of the highest energy neutrons; however, more total
neutrons are produced by proton interactions on helium. The
threshold for neutron production is lower for the $p$-$\alpha$
interactions, less than 100 MeV, and the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ inelastic
threshold is about 9.5 MeV/nucleon.

Although neutron production in the solar atmosphere comes from a
large variety of processes, the highest energy neutrons are from $p$-$p$
interactions at GeV energies. These high energy neutrons are most likely
to survive neutron decay and can be detected by ground-based detectors at the Earth.

\section{Soft X-ray emission}
\hspace{40pt}
The solar flares are very hot, so they emit
X-ray radiation. The intensity of X-rays increases
when a solar flare occurs. Because X-rays are absorbed in the
Earth's atmosphere, then X-ray flares must be observed by monitoring
satellites in space. The peak soft X-ray fluxes for solar flares as
observed by \emph{the Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellites}, or GOES for short, are used to classify solar flare
intensity (see Table \ref{table:2}). These soft X-rays are at low
energy ($\leq$ 10 keV) and have wavelengths between 0.1 to 0.8 nm.

During solar flares that have high temperatures, the soft X-rays are
released by the bremsstrahlung process of free electrons that move
at high speed near the ions. When the electrons move near a proton
they are deflected, so they emit electromagnetic radiation in the
process (Figure \ref{fig:brem}).

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{brem.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Bremsstrahlung process when an electron moves near a
proton} \label{fig:brem}
\end{figure}

The time profile of soft X-rays is taken to indicate the time of
occurrence of the flare. For the solar neutron events, every event
for which solar neutrons were reliably observed had the solar flare
classified in the maximum class, i.e, they were X class flares.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Soft X-ray classification of solar flares, based on fluxes at the Earth}
  \label{table:2}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Importance} & \textbf{Peak flux at 0.1 to 0.8 nm} \\
    & (W m$^{-2}$) \\ \hline
    A & $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-7}$ \\
    B & $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-6}$ \\
    C & $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-5}$ \\
    M & $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-4}$ \\
    X & $\geq 10^{-4}$ \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Hard X-ray emission}
\hspace{40pt}
Hard X-rays are the highest energy X-rays, typically
greater than 30 keV, and can be observed by spacecraft. Hard X-rays
originate from bremsstrahlung processes of relativistic electrons.
Hard X-rays are emitted during the impulsive onset of a solar flare,
while the soft X-rays gradually build up in strength and peak a few
minutes after the impulsive emission. This is called the Neupert
effect and arises because non-thermal hard X-rays indicate energy
input, whereas thermal soft X-rays indicate the time of primary
energy content, related to the time integral of the energy input.

Thus the time profile of the hard X-rays emission indicates the time
of primary energy release in the flare.

\section{Gamma-ray emission}
\hspace{40pt}
High energy interactions of particles in solar flares
are associated with $\gamma$-ray emission. Protons and heavier ions
are accelerated to high energy during solar flares, and precipitate
down into the chromosphere and photosphere where they produce
nuclear reactions and generate $\gamma$-rays. Nuclear interactions
in flares emit $\gamma$-rays over a variety of energies from 0.4 to
7 MeV. The annihilation of positrons from both charged pion and
radioactive beta decay leads to the 0.511 MeV $\gamma$-ray line.
Nuclear de-excitation lines produce $\gamma$-ray energies from about
4 to 7 MeV. Interactions of a proton or $\alpha$ particle with a
heavy nucleus in the dense solar atmosphere result in break-up into
lighter fragments that are left in excited states that de-excite to
emit $\gamma$-ray lines.

Slow neutrons produced in solar flares can be captured by a
photospheric proton to form deuterium, which emits a characteristic
$\gamma$-ray line with energy 2.223 MeV. The appearance of neutron
capture line emission is delayed, typically by one hundred seconds,
from the time of flare acceleration since the neutrons must slow
down before they are captured by a proton. The time profile of this
$\gamma$-ray line is the best to indicate time that neutron are
produced because $\gamma$-rays travel with a definite velocity,
i.e., the speed of light.

\section{Types of observations of solar neutrons}
\hspace{40pt} This research propose a test to find solar neutrons
detected by ground-based neutron monitors. There are also other ways
to observe solar neutrons that can confirm or refute the detection
at ground level.

The first way to observe solar neutrons was the observation directly
by a spacecraft detector, usually a $\gamma$-ray detector. For the
21 June 1980 solar flare event, the Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) on
the \emph{Solar Maximum Mission}(SMM) satellite observed a transient
flux of solar neutrons at the Earth with a greater than 13 $\sigma$
statistical significance \cite{Chupp1982}.

We can also observe solar neutrons by means of decay protons and
electrons. A free neutron decays according to $n \rightarrow p + e^-
+ \nu_e$. Observations of protons from the decay of solar neutrons
were reported by Evenson et al.\ 1983 from the 9 June 1982 solar
flare event. From the geometry of the event the magnetic field line
from the flare site did not connect with the Earth. Instead, the
ISEE 3 spacecraft observed a prompt flux of 25-45 MeV protons from
neutron decay along the magnetic field connecting with the Earth.

In addition, the observation of neutrons from decay electrons was
reported by Dr\" oge et al.\ 1996 \cite{Droge}. For the solar flare
event on 21 June 1980, the decay electrons arrived at the spacecraft
shortly before the electrons from the flare and could be
distinguished from the latter by their distinctive energy spectrum.

\section{Summary}
\hspace{40pt}
Observations of solar neutrons can be associated with
phenomena related to the occurrence of solar neutrons, including
solar neutron flares with soft X-ray, hard X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray
emissions. A solar neutron flare has high energy processes to
produce high energy neutrons, and the soft X-ray and hard X-ray time
profiles can indicate the time of the solar flare event. The time
profiles of $\gamma$-ray emissions can be used to estimate the time
when the ions and solar neutrons were produced and the neutron
capture $\gamma$-ray line time profile is the best way to estimate
the time of production of solar neutrons.

\chapter[Literature Review]{Literature Review on Ground-Based Detection of Solar Neutrons}
\hspace{40pt}
High energy particles and ions from the Sun and outer
space include protons, neutrons, electrons and gamma rays. When
these high energy particles arrive to the Earth and collide with the
Earth's atmosphere, they produce showers of secondary cosmic rays.
Particles found in the showers include neutrons, muons and electrons
that ground based detectors, i.e., neutron monitors, muon detectors
and neutron telescopes, near the sub-solar point can detect at a
higher count rate than normally at the time of the event.

Solar neutrons are high energy neutrons that are produced by high
energy processes at the Sun. The solar neutrons travel directly from
the Sun at a high speed nearly at the speed of light and produce an
increased count rate at neutron monitors for a few minutes after the
event. In the literature, there are reports of several events that
produced an increase in the count rate of ground-based detectors
that can be attributed to solar neutrons impacting the top of the
atmosphere. The neutron monitors that observed solar neutrons are
listed in Table \ref{table:nm}, the times of phenomena associated
with the solar neutron events are shown in Table \ref{ltable}, and
Table \ref{table:sn} summarizes the time and significance of solar
neutron detection.

\section[The solar neutron event on 3 June 1982]{The solar neutron event on 3 June 1982 (Chupp et al.\ 1987)}
\hspace{40pt} This was the first solar neutron event detected by
ground-based neutron monitors. On 3 June 1982 at 1141 UT an X8/2B
white light flare was produced. SMM/GRS detected an intense 59-199
keV X-ray burst and $\gamma$-ray line event at around 1143-1144 UT.
At this time neutron monitors at Jungfraujoch, Lomnick\' y \v St\'
it and Rome had an increase over their normal count rates during
this time interval.

Beginning with the time interval 1144-1145 UT, the Jungfraujoch neutron monitor count rate
shows a statistically significant enhancement over the average rate until about 1155 UT,
 reaching a maximum increase of about 5\% in 1 minute averages
(Figure \ref{fig:3jun82}). The 5-minute count rates in the time
interval 1145-1150 UT were 6.7$\sigma$ and 8.5$\sigma$ higher at the
high altitude monitors Jungfraujoch and Lomnick\'y \v St\'it,
respectively. The percentage increases of these two stations were
4.21\% and 2.8\%, respectively,  in that time interval. Rome showed
a small increase during 1145-1150 UT at 2.04\% or 2.9$\sigma$ above
the background level.

\end{figure}

\section[The solar neutron event on 24 May 1990]{The solar neutron event on 24 May 1990 (Shea et al.\ 1991)}
\hspace{40pt} This was the largest solar neutron event ever observed
by ground-based monitors. The station that best observed this event
is the Climax neutron monitor located at high altitude, 3400 m above
sea level, with a solar zenith angle of 28.8$^\circ$ at the time of
this event.
 Furthermore, there are several other neutron monitors in North America that observed this event.

The start time of the flare was around 2046 UT. It  emitted X9.3 level soft X-rays
as observed by GOES. Also at around 2046 UT, there was a type IV radio burst.
 The $\gamma$-ray emission occurred at around 2048 UT when 4-7 MeV and 2.2
 MeV emission
reached a maximum. Then at 2100 UT there was a type II radio burst.
The cosmic ray data from the worldwide network of neutron monitors
shows an abrupt increase to 26.0\% over background level during
2049-2050 UT at the Climax neutron monitor and the maximum increase
of intensity was 31.4\% above the background. The cosmic ray
intensity observed at Climax had an amplitude of 25.3\% over the
2045-2055 UT time interval.

To ascertain the origin of the abrupt increase observed by the
Climax monitor, which in principle could be due to solar neutrons,
solar energetic ions, or galactic cosmic rays impacting the Earth's
atmosphere, when comparing with cosmic ray data from other neutron
monitors (Figure \ref{fig:24may90}), it was found that the cosmic
ray intensity for each of these monitor stations in the time
interval 2050-2055 UT was not organized by geomagnetic cutoff, as
would be expected for charged cosmic rays. Instead, the data are
well organized by path length through the atmosphere, as expected
for neutrons (due to atmospheric absorption). Therefore, this peak
can be attributed to neutrons impacting the top of the atmosphere
with sufficient energy to generate a nuclear cascade detectable at
the Earth surface.

\section[The solar neutron event on 22 March 1991]{The solar neutron event on 22 March 1991 (Pyle and Simpson, 1991)}
\hspace{40pt} On 22 March 1991 the 3B solar optical flare at
26$^\circ$ S 28$^\circ$ E was coincident with both an X9 solar X-ray
event and the onset of a solar neutron intensity increase rising to
$\sim$ 2-3\% as measured by the Haleakala 18-tube neutron monitor.
The X-ray onset was at 2243 UT. There was an observed 1.5\% increase
above the background level at Haleakala in Hawaii at vertical cutoff
rigidity 12.91 GV, atmospheric depth 724 g cm$^{-2}$ with angle
21$^\circ$ from the sub-solar point. The altitude of this station is
3033 m \cite{Pyle1991}. The soft X-rays of this flare were
classified as X9.4 and the GOES6 satellite recorded a 50\% increase
in the flux of protons at $\>$850 MeV, commencing about 3 hours
after the solar event, followed by the large flux of 10 MeV protons.
The peak flux of the 2.2 MeV $\gamma$-ray line was observed by the
Granat satellite about one minute after the onset time of the soft
X-rays \cite{Terekhov1996}. A search for protons at neutron monitor
energies from this event was negative.

The increased count rate in the Haleakala neutron monitor was
attributed to an enhanced flux of neutrons arriving just after the
beginning of the X-ray burst. The estimated significance at this
station was at the 5 to 6 $\sigma$ level (Figure \ref{fig:22mar91}).

\section[The solar neutron event on 4 June 1991]{The solar neutron event on 4 June 1991 (Muraki et al.\ 1992, Chiba et al.\ 1992, Struminsky et al.\ 1994)}
\hspace{40pt} The event on 4 June 1991 was the first time that solar
neutrons were recorded by three different types of  detectors, the
solar neutron telescope of Nagoya University, the Nagoya muon
telescope and the Mt.\ Norikura neutron monitor. In addition, there
was a significant signal at an air shower array attributed to solar
neutrons of energy greater than 10 GeV observed by scintillation
detectors of the Akeno Giant Air Shower Array (AGASA), located
between Tokyo and Mt.\ Norikura at a mean atmospheric depth of 920
g/cm$^{2}$. The flux of solar neutrons above 10 GeV is about 1 to 2
per m$^2$ s at the top of the atmosphere and lasted for more than 20
minutes after the solar flare.

The start time of the X-ray (X12.0) event was observed by GOES7 from
0337 UT to 0730 UT and the GRO satellite observed an $\gamma$-ray
burst to begin at 0341 UT. The $\gamma$-ray emission continued for
more than 110 minutes after the peak of emission. An apparent
discontinuity in the $\gamma$-ray intensity may have occurred during
satellite night, 0405-0430 UT. Also, a radio burst began at 03:37:30
UT and reached a maximum at 03:41:10 UT. An enhancement was observed
in the count rate at the Norikura neutron monitor (type 12NM64)
located at 36.18$^\circ$ N, 137.92$^\circ$ E, and the average
atmospheric depth over the station at that time was 736 g cm$^{-2}$.

There were two humps in the signal, first at 0340-0410 UT and then
at 0415-0505 UT. The maximum of the first enhancement, 0350-0355 UT,
had 9.6 $\sigma$ significance as shown in Figure \ref{fig:4jun91}.
This enhancement was attributed to solar neutrons because the
attenuation mean free paths of the cosmic ray particles are smaller
than those of the background and the corresponding count rate of the
night side neutron monitors did not show any enhancement.

Furthermore, cosmic ray increases were observed by both a muon telescope
and a neutron telescope at the Mount Norikura Cosmic-Ray Laboratory,
which has an elevation of 2770 m above sea level.
The geographical latitude is 36.10$^\circ$ N and the longitude is 137.55$^\circ$ E.
The zenith angle of the Sun at 0337 UT on June 4 was 18.9$^\circ$ and the solar neutron
telescope was set at a zenith angle of 15$^\circ$.

\caption{Five-minute count rate observed by the Norikura neutron
monitor on 4 June 1991 \cite{Struminsky1994}.} \label{fig:4jun91}
\end{figure}

The neutron telescope recorded a 4.4 $\sigma$ statistical
significance of signal for neutron kinetic energies between 50 and
360 MeV in the time interval 0340-0349 UT and for the muon telescope
the statistical significance of the signal is 4.9$\sigma$ in the
time interval 0347-0356 UT.

\section[The solar neutron event on 6 June 1991]{The solar neutron event on 6 June 1991 (Muraki et al.\ 1992, Watanabe et al.\ 2003)}
\hspace{40pt} An X12.0 class solar flare was observed at 0054 UT on
6 June 1991 and an increase of intensity of $\gamma$-rays was seen
at 0105-0106 UT. At the start time of the X12.0 flare, the Sun was
over the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Japan.

During this event, the Mt.\ Norikura station  had a vertical air mass of 730 g cm$^{-2}$ and the zenith angle of the Sun was 26$^\circ$.
The air mass along the line of sight to the Sun was 812 g cm$^{-2}$.
A clear excess was found between 0112 UT and 0142 UT. The statistical significance of the strongest excess is 3.96 $\sigma$ during 0112-0117 UT,
and the total significance for 30 minutes between 0112 and 0142 UT is 5.16 $\sigma$.

The Mt.\ Haleakala station, where the vertical air mass is 707 g
cm$^{-2}$ and the zenith angle of the Sun was 44.5$^\circ$, with an
air mass along the line of sight to the Sun of\ 991 g cm$^{-2}$,
found an enhancement between 0112 UT and 0127 UT. The statistical
significance of the strongest excess is 3.03 $\sigma$ during
0122-0127 UT and the total significance for 15 minutes is 4.28
$\sigma$ (Figure \ref{fig:norikura}).

\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{The time profile of neutrons detected by two neutron
monitors on 6 June 1991. The vertical axis is the counting rate per
5 minutes. The solid smooth line is the average background, and the
dashed lines are $\pm1\sigma$ from the background
\cite{Watanabe1991}.} \label{fig:norikura}
\end{figure}

There is a possibility that these excesses came from energetic ions.
However, the authors did not found evidence that the enhancement was
produced by energetic ions, such the measurements by the other
stations in the worldwide network of neutron monitors. Also the
proton channel of the GOES satellites did not show enhancements.
Therefore, these signals were attributed to solar neutrons.

\section[The solar neutron event on 15 June 1991]{The solar neutron event on 15 June 1991 (Kovaltsov et al.\ 1995)}
\hspace{40pt} The solar flare event on 15 June 1991 produced an
intense soft X-ray flux of X12 class. The best neutron monitor
station for ground-based solar neutron observations was the Alma-Ata
station located at Tien Shan mountain between eastern Kyrgyzstan and
western China where the zenith angle was 28$^\circ$ and the cutoff
value of this station is 6.7 GV. The response of a monitor to solar
neutrons depends on its altitude and solar zenith angle during the
observations. The significance of each 5-minute recording during the
increase is not high ($\le2.6\sigma$) but the probability of a
statistical artifact over the whole 20 minutes increase is
negligible. Thus, this increase could be caused by solar neutrons.

\section[The solar neutron event on 24 November 2000]{The solar neutron event on 24 November 2000 (Watanabe et al.\ 2003)}
\hspace{40pt} At the time 1451 UT, an X2.3 class flare was observed
by the GOES satellite and reached a maximum at 1513 UT. Around 1508
UT, a large amount of hard X-rays was observed. This time profile
can be used to indicate times when electron acceleration took place.
However, it is more useful to examine information of $\gamma$-rays
to estimate the acceleration time of ions. The time profile of the
$\gamma$-ray line at 2.223 MeV, due to neutron capture, showed that
neutrons were produced around 1508 UT.

At 1508 UT, the Sun was over Bolivia. The neutron monitor installed
at Mount Chacaltaya was the most suitable place for observing solar
neutrons. This station is located at 292.0$^\circ$E, 16.2$^\circ$S,
5250 m above sea level, the vertical air mass is 540 g cm$^{-2}$ and
the zenith angle of the Sun was 17.47$^\circ$, so the air mass along
the line of sight to the sun was 566 g cm$^{-2}$. A clear excess was
found between 1510 UT and 1525 UT, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:nov2000}. The statistical significance of each bin is 4.7
$\sigma$ at 1510-1515 UT, 2.4 $\sigma$ at 1515-1520 UT and 2.4
$\sigma$ at 1520-1525 UT. The total significance for 15 minutes,
between 1510 UT and 1525 UT, turned out to be 5.5 $\sigma$.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{nov2000.eps}

\caption{Five-minute count rate observed by the Bolivia neutron
monitor on 24 November 2000. The top panel is the time profile
observed by the neutron monitor. The solid smooth line is the
averaged background and dashed lines are $\pm1\sigma$ from the
background. The bottom panel is the statistical significance. The
clear excess made by solar neutrons observed from 1510 to 1525 UT
had a total significance of 5.5 $\sigma$ \cite{Watanabe2000}.}
\label{fig:nov2000}
\end{figure}

Not only solar neutrons can produce an increase of signal of neutron
monitors; in fact, such increases are usually due to energetic ions.
However, there is no evidence that this enhancement was produced by
energetic ions since the measurements by other stations in the
worldwide network of neutron monitors showed no enhancement. In
addition, the cutoff rigidity at Mount Chacaltaya is high, that is,
12.53 GV, so it is difficult for solar energetic ions, which have a
soft spectrum, to reach this location. Furthermore, protons of
kinetic energy greater than 100 MeV were observed by the GOES
satellite in association with the X2.3 solar flare, which was
observed 1 hour later. These signals could be produced from the
decay of solar neutrons.

\section[The solar neutron event on 25 August 2001]{The solar neutron event on 25 August 2001 (Watanabe et al.\ 2003)}
\hspace{40pt} A soft X-ray flare classified as X5.3 was observed by
GOES satellites at 1623 UT on August 25, 2001 and reached a maximum
at 1645 UT. Large fluxes of hard X-rays and $\gamma$-rays were also
observed in this event by the Yohkoh/HXT and Yohkoh/GRS. The fluxes
of the hard X-rays and $\gamma$-rays were maximal at 1632 UT, so we
deduce that solar neutrons might be produced at this time.

At the start time of the flare on 25 August 2001, the neutron
monitor installed at Mt.\ Chacaltaya in Bolivia was the most
suitable place for observing solar neutrons. At this time, the
zenith angle of the Sun was 26.5$^\circ$ and the air mass along the
line of sight to the Sun was 603 g cm$^{-2}$.

The enhancement was observed between 1634 UT and 1640 UT. This had
significance 4.7 $\sigma$ at 1634-1636 UT, 1.4 $\sigma$ at 1639-1644
UT and 2.5 $\sigma$ at 1644-1649 UT. The total significance for 15
minutes is 4.7 $\sigma$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:25aug01}.

\section[The solar neutron event on 28 October 2003]{The solar neutron event on 28 October 2003 (Bieber et al.\ 2005, Watanabe et al.\ 2005)}
\hspace{40pt} The solar flare was observed at 0951 UT with the X17.2
soft X-ray classification. The maximum intensity of soft X-rays
occurred at 1110 UT. The large fluxes of hard X-rays and
$\gamma$-rays were observed by the INTEGRAL satellite after 1100 UT.
The time of peak intensity of $\gamma$-rays at 4-7 MeV occurred at
1105 UT and the 2.2 MeV neutron capture $\gamma$-ray line peaked at
1106 UT. At 1105 UT on 28 October 2003, the Sun was located over
Africa and the Tsumeb neutron monitor at Namibia observed a small
but clear increase in count rate.

This neutron monitor station is located at 19.2$^\circ$S
17.58$^\circ$E, 1240 m above sea level, and the cutoff rigidity is
9.21 GV. The zenith angle of the Sun was 8.4$^\circ$ and the clear
excess of signal was seen in five-minute count rates between 1105
and 1115 UT with the total significance 6.4$\sigma$ (see Figure
\ref{fig:28oct03}).

\section[The solar neutron event on 2 November 2003]{The solar neutron event on 2 November 2003 (Watanabe et al.\ 2005)}
\hspace{40pt} The solar flare on 2 November 2003 was associated with
an intense X8.3 class soft X-ray event observed at 1703 UT in NOAA
active region 10486. The location of this region was S14W56. A large
flux of $\gamma$-ray emission was observed by the RHESSI satellite.
The intensity of 4-7 MeV $\gamma$-rays from de-excited nuclei
reached a maximum at 1717 UT and the 2.2 MeV neutron capture line
peaked at 1718 UT. At the time of the flare, the Sun was over South
America so that the Chacaltaya neutron monitor station was the most
suitable station to observe solar neutrons. At 1717 UT, the zenith
angle of the Sun was 14.9$^\circ$ with an air mass along the line of
sight to the Sun of 559 g cm$^{-2}$. A clear excess count rate was
found between 1725 and 1750 UT with the statistical significance of
4.7$\sigma$ in 5-minute count rate data (Figure \ref{fig:2nov03}).

\section[The solar neutron event on 4 November 2003]{The solar neutron event on 4 November 2003 (Watanabe et al.\ 2005)}
\hspace{40pt} An X28 class solar flare occurred at 1929 UT in NOAA
active region 10486 at S19$^\circ$ W83$^\circ$ and the intensity of
soft X-ray emission reached to maximum around 1942 UT. After that,
hard X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission was observed by the INTEGRAL
spacecraft. The peak of the de-excitation $\gamma$-ray line at 4-7
MeV was observed at 1944 UT and the neutron capture $\gamma$-ray
line was observed at 1945 UT.

At 1945 UT, the Sun was located between Hawaii and South America.
The zenith angle of the Sun was 50.5$^\circ$ at Haleakala
 and the air mass along the line of sight to the Sun was 1112 g cm$^{-2}$.
Otherwise, there is the Mexico City station where the zenith angle of the Sun was 40.52$^\circ$
and the air mass along the line of sight to the Sun was 1026 g/cm$^{-2}$.
These two stations were the most suitable stations for observing solar neutrons.
Haleakala saw a clear excess from 1945 to 2000 UT with
 the statistical significance of 7.5$\sigma$.
For the Mexico City, a clear excess was seen at the same time as
Haleakala and the significance was 5.2$\sigma$ (Figure
\ref{fig:4nov03}).

\section{Summary of the literature}\label{sumlit}
\hspace{40pt} According to the observations of solar neutrons in the
literature, we can summarize as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Most neutron monitors that have observed solar neutron
events are located near the Equator.
  \item The average time duration of the solar neutron signal is 15
  minutes.
  \item The time duration of a solar neutron signal is not over 30
  minutes.
  \item All solar events with reported solar neutron events had the
  intensity of soft X-rays classified in class X.
  \item The signal of solar neutrons is always observed in local
daytime. In this survey the times were between 09:20 and 16:10. To
be safe, we might consider it possible to observe solar neutrons
between 08:00 and 17:00 local time.
  \item The increase in count rate due to solar neutrons is small,
  so good statistics are needed to evaluate whether or not an increase
of count rate in a neutron monitor is due to solar neutrons.
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Statistics of Solar Neutrons}

\section{Relevant statistical concepts}
\hspace{40pt} The literature review in the previous chapter shows
that ground-based stations that observe solar neutrons should be
located at high altitude and the Sun should have a small zenith
angle at the time of the event, because neutrons move along a
straight line path from the Sun and are absorbed by Earth's
atmosphere. At any given station, solar neutron detection is quite
rare at about 0 to 3 per decade.

Normally, the count rate in a neutron monitor is due to GCRs. The
number of GCRs typically varies slowly and when a solar flare
occurs, an increase of the count rate due to solar neutrons occurs
over a short time duration. Afterward, the flux goes back down to
the background level. However, the background count rate has random
fluctuations that might also produce a signal like this. Statistical
methods are needed to decide whether or not an increase of the count
rate in a neutron monitor is a signal from solar neutrons. The
5-minute count rate data are the best data set for observing solar
neutrons because the solar neutron signal is over a short time
duration for 5 to 30 minutes. We could observe a solar neutron
signal from 1-minute data from neutron monitors, but there are
greater statistical fluctuations and it is hard to see a clear
excess of signal.

Let $y_1$, $y_2$, $y_3$, $\ldots$ , $y_n$ be a random sample from a
population with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. We can use
$\bar{y}$, the average count rate, to estimate the mean, $\mu$, of
the count rate of cosmic ray intensity:
\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
\mu \simeq \bar{y} = \frac{1}{N} \sum y_i .
\end{equation}
\noindent The standard deviation $\sigma$ of the parent population
can be estimated from the data according to
\begin{equation}\label{eq2}
\sigma \simeq s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum \left(y_i - \bar{y}
\right)^2},
\end{equation}
\noindent which gives an uncertainty $\sigma_\mu$ in the
determination of the mean,
\begin{equation}\label{eq3}
\sigma_\mu = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}} \simeq \frac{s}{\sqrt{N}},
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\sigma_\mu$ is referred to as the standard
deviation of the mean, or the standard error.

The GCR background not only depends on the altitude and cutoff
rigidity of the station, but it also depends on pressure. If the
pressure increases with time, the number of counts will decrease. We
only use pressure-corrected count rates. A Forbush decrease, due to
a coronal mass ejection from the Sun, will reduce the count rate of
the GCR background for up to a week. We treat the time variation of
the background by using a linear regression model as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:lgraph}. If the GCR rate does not change with time, the
slope of the linear model should be zero.
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{lgraph.eps}\\
  \end{center}
  \caption{A simple linear model.}\label{fig:lgraph}
\end{figure}

The expectation value of the count rate, $\hat{y}$, is defined by
Equation (\ref{eq4}), where $\beta_0$ is the $y$-intercept and
$\beta_1$ is the slope of this model:
\begin{equation}\label{eq4}
    \hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0  + \hat{\beta}_1 x.
\end{equation}
The parameters $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ can be found by
the least squares method. Details of this method are shown in
Appendix A. The first step in finding the least-squares best-fit
line is to find the sums of the $x^2$ values and the cross-products
of the corresponding $x$ and $y$ values $\left(\sum\ xy\right)$ for
all data points. The second step is to substitute the values of
$\sum\ x$, $\sum\ y$, $\sum\ x^2$ and $\sum\ xy$ into the formulas
for SS$_{xy}$ and SS$_{xy}$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{SS}_{xy} &=& \sum\ xy - \frac{\left(\sum\
x\right)\left(\sum\
    y\right)}{n}\label{eq5}\\
\mathrm{SS}_{xx} &=& \sum\ x^{2} - \frac{\left(\sum\
x\right)^{2}}{n}.\label{eq6}
\end{eqnarray}

Finally, we use these values of SS$_{xy}$ and SS$_{xx}$ to calculate
the estimates $\hat{\beta}_1$ and $\hat{\beta}_0$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq7}
    \hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\mathrm{SS}_{xy}}{\mathrm{SS}_{xx}}\ ,\qquad
    \hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}
\end{equation}

The data from a neutron monitor are analyzed, using the 5-minute or
1-minute count rate data. When this method is applied for use with
time series data, the $x$ value (time) is defined to be zero at the
midpoint of the data set, times before the midpoint are negative,
and times after the midpoint are positive. These $x$ values will
make $\sum\ x$ equal to zero. Then the values of SS$_{xy}$ and
SS$_{xx}$ in Equations (\ref{eq5}) and (\ref{eq6}) are simply $\sum\
xy$ and $\sum\ x^2$, respectively.

The uncertainty of the least squares line is determined by a measure
of the variability of the $y$ values or an estimation of $\sigma^2$.
This value is given by
\begin{equation}
s^2 = \frac{\mathrm{SSE}}{n-2},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{eqnarray} \mathrm{SSE} = \sum\left(y-\hat{y}\right)^2 =
\mathrm{SS}_{yy} - \hat{\beta}_1 \mathrm{SS}_{xy}\\
\mathrm{SS}_{yy} = \sum\left(y - \bar{y}\right)^2 = \sum\ y^2 -
\frac{\left(\sum\ y\right)^2}{n}.
\end{eqnarray}

After that, we use a statistical check of the usefulness of the
model. That is a hypothesis test in which the null hypothesis is
that the parameter $\beta_1$ or slope of the linear model is equal
to zero, and the alternative hypothesis is that $\beta_1$ is not
equal to zero:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{H_{0}}: \beta_1 &=& 0 \nonumber\\
\mathrm{H_{1}}: \beta_1 &\neq& 0.
\end{eqnarray}
The test statistic is the $t$-statistic. This $t$-test is based on
Student's $t$ distribution. The test is value calculated from
\begin{equation}\label{eq8}
    t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1}{s/\sqrt{\mathrm{SS}_{xx}}}.
\end{equation}
The null hypothesis is rejected where $|t|\ >\ t_{\alpha/2, n-2}$.
The distribution of $t$ is based on $n-2$ degrees of freedom, and
$t_{\alpha/2}$ is the $t$ value such that $P(|t|>t_{\alpha/2 ,n-2})
= 1-\alpha$.

The decision of whether or not an increase of count rate represents
solar neutrons is based on the hypothesis that the increase in count
rate is inconsistent with statistical fluctuations of the
background. The hypothesis test compared the signal  to the
background. The null hypothesis is that the signal is absent from
the data and the alternative hypothesis is the signal is present:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{H_{0}} : \bar{y}_s \leq \bar{y}_b \nonumber \\
\mathrm{H_{1}} : \bar{y}_s > \bar{y}_b,
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent where $\bar{y}_s$ is the estimated mean rate of the signal
$+$ background and $\bar{y}_b$ is the estimated mean rate of
background. The confidence level of decisions on this hypothesis is
$(1-\alpha)100\%$, where $\alpha$ is probability of a Type I error
that occurs from rejecting H$_{0}$ when it is true \cite{Statistic}.
The null hypothesis is rejected when the test statistic is higher
than the statistic of significance level, $\alpha$.

The statistic used to test the hypothesis is based on the normal
distribution. The statistic test value for the large sample is $z$
that based on normal distribution and if we have a small sample, we
use the following $t$ value instead as shown in Equation
(\ref{teststat}). The $t$ distribution is very like the $z$
distribution. In particular, both are symmetric and have a mean of
0. However, the $t$ distribution is more variable. The distribution
of $t$ depends on its degrees of freedom, defined by $\nu = n_s +
n_b -2$, where $n_s$ and $n_b$ are the number of signal and
background interval, respectively. The test statistic is
\begin{equation}\label{teststat}
    t = \frac{\bar{y}_s -
\bar{y}_b}{s},
\end{equation}
where $s = \sqrt{\frac{s^{2}_{s}}{n_s}+\frac{s^{2}_{b}}{n_b}}$.

\section{The solar event on 20 January 2005}
\hspace{40pt} On 20 January 2005, there was a solar event with an
intense soft X-ray emission peaking in class X7.1 at 0701 UT with a
GLE, i.e., an observed enhancement of charged SEP at several neutron
monitor stations. As a check of our statistical methods, we examine
whether there was a significant increase in the count rate of the
MicroMonitor operating at Chulalongkorn University at the time of
the event. Such an increase would be due to solar protons,
\emph{not} solar neutrons. The MicroMonitor is single $^{10}$BF$_3$
proportional tube for a neutron monitor without the surrounding lead
or polyethylene. The MicroMonitor is located at 13.45$^\circ$N,
100.35$^\circ$E and 32 m above sea level. To evaluate a possible
detection, we used a hypothesis test. The signal period started at
0700 UT. We set linear regression to examine the background.

The results, including the means, standard  deviation (Stdev or
$s$), standard error of mean (SE), and the number $N$ of background
and signal periods are shown in Table \ref{tab:20jan}. From this
test, we did not find a significant signal from solar protons at
this small, sea-level, equatorial detector (see Figure
\ref{fig:20jan}). We calculate
\begin{equation}\label{upper}
    k = (\bar{y}_s - \bar{y}_b) + t_{\alpha}s
\end{equation}
\noindent where $k$ is an upper limit according to the objectives of
this thesis and $t_{\alpha}$ is the value of $t$ at the upper
confidence level of the significance value $\alpha$. The upper limit
on the signal during this event, calculated from Equation
(\ref{upper}), is 159.4 counts per 10-minute interval, or a 4.51\%
increase at the 95\% confidence level, or $\alpha = 0.05$.

\section{Searching for solar neutrons over a general time period}
\hspace{40pt} To search for a signal of solar neutrons from neutron
monitor data over a general time period, we have developed the
following procedure. Note that we use two models, a  and b, as shown
in Figure \ref{fig:b}. The following procedure uses for Model A up
to step 5, and then uses Model B as a further check (if needed).

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use the 5-minute or 1-minute count rate of neutron monitor data.
The 5-minute binning is more useful because it reduces the
fluctuations of the background cosmic ray intensity in comparison
with the 1-minute count rate. The hourly rate cannot be used because
a solar neutron event occurred over a short time, so the hourly rate
may not indicate the signal of a solar neutron event.
  \item Search for increases in the count rate that might be a solar neutron signal
by checking each count rate that has a higher count rate than the
preceding count rate with the significance level $\alpha = 0.01$.
  \item If we find an increased count rate from step 2, we compare
this possible signal with the preceding background, averaged over
$N$ time intervals. To find the number of background intervals $N$,
we use linear regression to model the background vs.\ time and test
whether the slope is consistent with zero at the 95\% confidence
level. If so, we increase $N$ as much as possible while still giving
a slope of background consistent with zero for finding the largest
number of count rate bins that can be used to estimate a constant
background. However, if the slope is not consistent with zero at the
starting value of $N$ ($N$ corresponding to 6, or 30 minutes), we
use these $N$ time intervals to estimate the background. In any
case, we limit $N$ to no more than 36 bins or 3 hours. For 1-minute
data, we limit $N$ to no more than 180 bins.
  \item Calculate an estimate of the mean and standard deviation of
the background and signal. From the previous chapter, the estimated
duration time of a solar neutron signal is 15 minutes as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:b}.
  \item Calculate the statistic used to test the hypothesis.
  \item If the null hypothesis is rejected, we repeat Steps 4 and 5 with $N/2$ additional background intervals, starting 15 minutes after the signal
  period, to further test the hypothesis (Figure \ref{fig:b}b).
  \item Decide whether the rate increase found in the neutron monitor is a signal from
solar neutrons.
\end{enumerate}

  \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{back2.eps}\\
  \caption{Models of a solar neutron event. a) Model A: with this
  method, $\bar{y_b}$ is the average background count rate of cosmic
  rays during $N$ time periods previous to the time of the possible
  signal, and $\bar{y_s}$ is the average signal $+$ background. b)
  Model B: with this method, $\bar{y_b}$ is averaged from $N$ time
  periods previous to the possible signal and $N/2$ time periods
  starting 15 minutes after the time of the possible signal
  period.}\label{fig:b}
\end{figure}

The method to identify solar neutron signals is concluded in the
flow chart shown in Figure \ref{fig:flow}. The data are corrected
for the effect of pressure before evaluating the statistic. We also
require a local time between 08:00 and 17:00 since solar neutrons
only occur in local daytime. For Model B, the reason why we consider
the signal over 15 minutes is because in the literature the average
time of signal duration is about 15 minutes. We consider the
background before the signal period and starting 15 minutes after
the signal period because the signal period may be longer than 15
minutes. This method can help to eliminate increases due to ground
level enhancements (GLEs) of charged solar particles, or due to
Forbush decrease recovery, for which the count rate does not return
to the background after 30 minutes.

We wrote a computer program comparing the signal count rate and the
previous count rate, which are considered to be from the different
populations. We test the program for data from the Tsumeb station
during October, 2003, checking every 5 minutes in the data. The
results of the program show significant increases, i.e., candidate
solar neutron signals, at only one time period as shown in Table
\ref{Table:signal}.

\section{Solar neutrons in October, 2003}
\hspace{40pt} We examined data from the Tsumeb neutron monitor
station located in Namibia in southern Africa, for October 2003, in
order to test our methods by looking for a signal of solar neutrons.
This station detected an increase in count rate due to solar
neutrons on October, 28 (Bieber et al.\ 2005). These data were
kindly provided by Prof.\ Harm Moraal, Northwest University, South
Africa. The time of increase of the count rate was at 11:05 to 11:20
UT. For evaluating this solar event, using the 1-minute count rate
of Tsumeb data, we calculate both the mean and standard deviation in
background and signal periods. According to our hypothesis test the
mean of background and signal are from different populations. We aim
to verify that the method correctly identifies the true solar
neutron signal and to measure the number of false positives (Table
\ref{Table:signal}), which actually did not occur.

\chapter{Discussion and Conclusions}
\hspace{40pt} Solar neutrons are produced from high energy processes
in solar flares that have the soft X-ray emission of class X. Other
phenomena associated with solar neutrons are produced, such as the
$\gamma$-ray emission. The time profile of the neutron capture line
at 2.223 MeV is the best estimator of the time profile of solar
neutron production.

The statistical method used to evaluate the detection of signals of
solar neutrons at the 95\% confidence level at the Tsumeb neutron
monitor station in southern Africa has not found false alarms during
October, 2003. The signal that was found from this station by the
statistical method is generally recognized as a true signal (data
shown in \ref{Table:signal}; see also Section 3.9). The results from
the statistical method could be checked with the local time of the
station.

The linear regression method is used to avoid the time variation of
background which helps us to correctly perform the hypothesis test
in the solar event time analysis. However, if the results from this
a priori statistical method were to have false positives, that might
occur from the increase of count rate data from statistical
fluctuations, GLEs, or Forbush decrease recoveries. Model B in
Figure \ref{fig:b} is designed to eliminate the latter two, because
these events have an increase over long duration time compared with
solar neutron events. Then the linear regression for the preceding
background and background after signal did not have slope consistent
with zero. In further consideration of whether a candidate signal is
a true solar neutron signal, we note that GLEs and Forbush decreases
should be observed by several stations, whereas solar neutrons are
not. In particular, a GLE of solar protons or Forbush decrease
recovery of galactic protons should have a stronger percent increase
at high-latitude stations. We expect to make use of this method when
analyzing data from neutron monitors, especially the Princess
Sirindhorn Neutron Monitor at Doi Inthanon.

For the decision as to whether solar neutrons are detected, we must
also consider the phenomena related to solar neutron events, such as
the time of the solar flare event, for which the soft X-ray emission
should have an intensity at (or near) class X (see Section
\ref{sumlit}). The neutron monitor stations that observe the solar
neutrons should be located near the Equator, at high altitude, and
with a small zenith angle of the Sun at the time of the event. If
the station that is believed to observe solar neutrons has a large
zenith angle, it could be checked whether other stations located
with a smaller zenith angle found a signal or not.

between two or more measured variables. Linear regression is use to
describe two variables that are related by a linear function:
\begin{equation}\label{linear}
y(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x.
\end{equation}
By using the method of least squares to find values of the
parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ that minimize the discrepancy
between the measured values $y_i$ and calculated value $y(x)$ with
the assumption of a Gaussian distribution of measurement
uncertainty, the probability $P_i$ of making the measurement $y_i$
standard deviation $\sigma_i$ is for the observation about the
actual value $y_i$ with
\begin{equation}\label{gauss}
P_i = \frac{1}{\sigma_i \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}
\left[\frac{y_i - y(x_i)}{\sigma_i}\right]^2\right\}.
\end{equation}
Similarly, for any estimated values of the parameters, we can
calculate the probability of obtaining the observed set of
measurements as
\begin{equation}\label{estprob}
    P(\beta_0 ,\beta_1) = \left[\prod_{i} \left(\frac{1}{\sigma_i
    \sqrt{2\pi}}\right)\right]
    \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2} \sum\left[\frac{y_i -
    y(x_i)}{\sigma_i}\right]^2\right\}
\end{equation}
The first factor on the right side of Equation (\ref{estprob}) is a
constant, independent of the values of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, so
maximizing the probability $P(\beta_0 ,\beta_1)$ is equivalent to
minimizing the sum in the exponential, defined as the goodness of
fit parameter $\chi^2$:
\begin{equation}\label{chi}
    \chi^2 = \sum\left[\frac{y_i - y(x_i)}{\sigma_i}\right]^{2} =
    \sum\left[\frac{y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i}{\sigma_i}\right]^2.
\end{equation}
For simple linear regression assume that $\sigma_i = \sigma$ for all
data points. The least squares estimator of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$
is defined as $\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1}$. Finding these by
minimizing $\chi^2$,
\begin{eqnarray}
% \nonumber to remove numbering (before each equation)
  \frac{\partial\chi^2}{\partial\beta_0}\Bigg|_{\hat{\beta_0},\hat{\beta_1}} &=& -2\sum \left(y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i\right)=0\\
  \frac{\partial\chi^2}{\partial\beta_1}\Bigg|_{\hat{\beta_0},\hat{\beta_1}}&=& -2\sum \left(y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1
  x_i\right)x_i = 0.
\end{eqnarray}
Simplifying these two equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
% \nonumber to remove numbering (before each equation)
  \sum y_i &=& n\hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}\sum x_i \\
  \sum x_i y_i &=& \hat{\beta_0}\sum x_i + \hat{\beta_1}\sum
  x^{2}_i.
\end{eqnarray}
From these two equations we can find the estimated parameter
$\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1}$:
\begin{equation}\label{beta}
    \left[\begin{array}{c}\hat{\beta_0}\\ \hat{\beta_1}\end{array}\right] = \frac{1}{n\sum x^{2}_i - \left(\sum
    x_i\right)^2} \left[\begin{array}{cc} \sum x^{2}_i & -\sum x_i \\
    -\sum x_i & n\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c} \sum y_i
    \\ \sum x_i y_i\end{array}\right].
\end{equation}
The solution is
\begin{eqnarray}
% \nonumber to remove numbering (before each equation)
  \hat{\beta_1} &=& \frac{\sum x_i y_i - \frac{\left(\sum x_i\right)\left(\sum y_i\right)}{n}}{\sum x^{2}_i - \frac{\left(\sum x_i\right)^2}{n}} \\
  \hat{\beta_0} &=& \bar{y} - \hat{\beta_1}\bar{x},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ are the average of measurement value
$x$ and $y$, respectively.

\section{The $t$ Distribution}
\hspace{40pt} A better estimate of the probability when we have a
small data set can be obtained from Student's $t$ distribution,
which describes the distribution of the parameter $t = |x -
\bar{x}|/s_{\bar{x}}$, where $t$ is the number of standard
deviations of the sample distribution $s_{\bar{x}}$ by which $x$
differs from $\bar{x}$.

The $t$ probability density function is
\begin{equation}\label{tpdf}
p(t,\nu) = \frac{\Gamma\left[(\nu+1)/2\right]}{\sqrt{\pi
v}\Gamma(\nu/2)}\cdot \frac{1}{\left[(t^{2}/\nu) +
1\right]^{(\nu+1)/2}},
\end{equation}
where $\nu$ is the number of degrees of freedom. The general
appearance of the $t$ distribution is similar to the normal
distribution, but the $t$ distribution depends upon the number of
degrees of freedom $\nu = N-1$. In the limit of large $\nu$,
Student's $t$ and Gaussian probability distributions are the same,
where has the degree of freedom $\nu \geq 40$.
