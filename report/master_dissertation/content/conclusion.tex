% Overview of what we have study
In this study, the incident CR proton spectrum was tracing by 
using the limb $\gamma$-ray. The measured $\gamma$-ray spectrum
is contructing by taking the exposure of the LAT and
the effective area into account where on the Earth centered 
coordinates. The exposure calculation is calculated from the 
relation of the angle between the LAT's boresight and nadir angle 
because given nadir angle and the spacecraft orientation affects the 
performance of the measurement. After that, an indirect measurement 
of the proton spectrum was inversely computed via the
$pp\rightarrow\gamma$ interaction model with a heuristic optimization
technique.


% fermi-lat mission -> gamma induction -> this study
Since the \textit{Fermi}-LAT was launched in June 2008.
The data has been collected from 7 August 2008 to 16 October 2017.
