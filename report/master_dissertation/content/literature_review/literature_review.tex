% source of cr & introduce acceleration mechanism
Cosmic-ray could came from different origin from galactic sources
to extra-galactic sources. The kinetic energy of cosmic ray also 
highly depends on where does it from. Low energy CRs usually came from 
the Sun called ``solar energetic particle''. The production process of 
soalr particle event mostly came from the coronal mass ejection (CME)
when HZE ions was dragged by a magnetic field in the plasma.
The extra-galactic CRs typically 
has high momentum from the extreme condition of the accelation mechanism
in pulsar, quasars and supernova remnant (SNR). 
The theoretical description of accelation in SNR and solar flares
is the shock wave accelation in following paragraph.

% acceleration mechanism
One of the most impactful study of CR's acceleration mechanism 
was conducted by \cite{fermi1949origin}. 
The study describes how high energy CR particle gain such a huge 
momentum from shock wave that was generated by supernovae 
or a great explosion from the heavy dense star. How it gains
the kinetic energy could be described as a first order shock 
acceleration and the overall spectrum of charged particles could be
represented as the power law in Equation \ref{eq:fermi_powerlaw}.

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dN(E)}{dE} \propto E^{-\gamma}
    \label{eq:fermi_powerlaw}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma \geq 2$ in the non-relativistic regime.
However, moving magnetized plasma cloud can accelate the charged 
particle in the space called "second-order Fermi acceleration".
Both regimes was computed the lorentzian forces regardless of 
thermal collision in the process.

% cosmic ray component paper
The CR protons is a major components in the arrival CR particles 
under multiple observations. However, $\alpha$-particle is also 
a second important CR particle when considering a precise calculation
of CR interactions. The other majority of heavy weight nucleis that 
could propagating through the space are C, O, Ne and so on. 
The differential flux in kinetic energy of multiple observations is 
visualzed in the Figure \ref{fig:cr_composition} under the work of 
\cite{review_particle_physics2012} to take various atomic nnumbers 
from various experiments.

% CR and Earth's magnetic field -> cutoff rigidity
% ctte -> cutoff rigidity
Since there is a moving plasma inside the Earth, the magnetic field 
has been generated from the dynamics of the moving charged ions in 
the plasma. The magnetic field of the Earth's has a north pole at 
the geometric south pole of the Earth and vice versa. 
The Earth's magnetic field play
an important roles in the arrival CR particles because the lorenzian 
forces will bend the direction of a moving charged particle depends 
on the rigidity of the particle.
This means the magetic field line mantiles the Earth with a
certain direction towards the geometric north pole.

% cite -> east-west
Firstly, it creates the CR cutoff rigidity on the terrestrial
where each location of the Earth's require a minimum rigidity of 
an incident charged particles as a condition for arrival. The 
Figure \ref{fig:cr_map_rigidity} shows a cutoff rigidity on the Earth's surface.

%  east-west and Explorer XI first observe cite{kraushaar1965explorer}
Secondly, incoming charged CRs with a charged has been dragged 
by the Earth's magnetic. Then a charged particle would moving as 
a curve or a spiral depends on the rigidity of an incoming particle
which leads to the East-West effects when an orbiting detector could 
find more particle on the West side more than the East side for 
a significant level of intensity. A pioneer Earth's $\gamma$-ray 
experiment is conducted by \cite{kraushaar1965explorer} where the 
detector was deployed on the Explorer XI satellite and orbiting in the sky.

The incoming photon from East and West direction is the crucial evidence 
of the bending of CRs trajectory by Earth's magnetosphere. The first 
analysis show a distinguishable intensity from East to West as visualized 
in Figure \ref{fig:gamma_ew}a. The second experiment where
the $\gamma$-ray detector is atteched on Third Orbiting Solar
Observatory (OSO-3) and collecting the $\gamma$-ray in MeV range.
The 2-D plot of the intensity is shown in Figure \ref{fig:gamma_ew}b.

% describe zenith
Moreover, An early analysis found 
that the observing $\gamma$-rays intensity along the zenith angle
from different geomagnetic latitude ($\lambda$) is differentiable
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:explorer_xi_zenith}. The reason behind 
this outcome came from the Earth's rigidity where the incoming 
particles near the equatorial has less chance to arrive than the 
north pole and likely to intereact with the atmospheric molecules 
and emits the $\gamma$-rays. This is the seceondary 
evidence of how geomagnetic fields play an important role on the 
trajectory of the CR particles.

% early earth gamma-ray observe -> SAS-2 (Thompson81),  EGRET (Petry05)
The following experiment of Earth's albedo observations is conducted 
by sending a second small astronomy satellite (SAS-2) with higher 
resolution in angle and observing above 35 MeV up to GeV range
(\cite{Thompson81}). The projected 3-D representation of intensity
is shown in Figure \ref{fig:gamma_earth_second_wave}a. A few decades 
later, another precise $\gamma-ray$ detector has been attached in the 
CGRO satellite (\cite{Petry05}). An outcome from the analysis 
illustrated the bright region around the Earth's limb region as 
in Figure \ref{fig:gamma_earth_second_wave}b.

% gamma from earth and moon \cite{Morris84}
The previous details is full of so many experimental evidences.
However, \cite{Morris84} put the weights on assumption of 
bright region as seen as albedo in $\gamma$-ray came from the 
interaction of proton and the atmospheric nucleis. The study
shows the $\gamma$-rays intensity and the variation of air depth 
by differing the zenith angle along limb region as plotted in 
Figure \ref{fig:emit_photon_vs_depth} and \cite{Thompson81} data 
has been exploit in the analysis.

\end{figure}

Furthermore, this study compute the $\gamma$-ray spectrum from 
the bright region as seen as albedo from the Earth's limb and 
lunar albedo. The Figure \ref{fig:gamma_spectrum_earth_lunar} 
shows the spectrum from theoretical calculation. Figure \ref{fig:gamma_spectrum_earth_lunar}a
identify the 2 bounds of the limb's region with an appromated air depth.
Appealingly, another evidence of the solar activity could cause 
a lower arrival CR particles since the propagating magnetic field 
drag a charged particle towards outer space. The distinguishable
spectrum from this phenomanon is demonstrated in
Figure \ref{fig:gamma_spectrum_earth_lunar}b.

\end{figure}

Not so long after \textit{Fermi}-LAT was launched in the sky. In 2009,
an early examination of the induced $\gamma$-ray emission was 
observed by the most precise $\gamma$-ray detector
\cite{fermilat_gamma_induced}. Since there 
is a huge improvement in the technological side which makes LAT 
capable of detecting high energy $\gamma$-ray from MeV up to TeV.
Another discovery from this study was a East-West effects is highly 
depends on the energy where it was converted from the incident 
energy of CR particles. The higher energy means the higher rigidity
and it would reflect how hard magnetic field could bend the trajectory.
The intensity was divided into 4 energy ranges from a few GeV 
to a higher GeV that could be considerd as the relativistic scheme 
where the kinetic energy is much higher than the mass as shown 
in Figure \ref{fig:fermi_eastwest}.

Since this work is to indirectly measure the proton spectrum in 
GeV range. The direct measurement in an early study of high energy 
CR particles such as proton and helium was observed by \cite{bess_experiment}.
Another following experiment is \cite{adriani2011pamela}. Both of 
them still lack of capability to detect such a high energy in scale of 
hundred GeV. Nevertheless, there is a clue about the breaking energy 
in the proton spectrum with a very low statistics and leave 
a room for the further study.


% previous work (indirect measurement) : FermiEarth14
Since there is just a clue from from the previous direct observations.
The indirect measurement of CR proton spectrum has been performed in
energy between 90 GeV to 6 TeV by taking advantage of the brighness of
Earth's limb from collision of incident CR protons (\cite{FermiEarth14}).
The 5 years of $\gamma$-ray data has been exploit by investigating the 
incident proton spectrum via proton-proton collision model for finding 
whether an CR protons has a breaking point of slope in the power 
law spectrum. The study found that there is a breaking spectral index
in proton spectrum above 200 GeV 
Nonetheless, Statistical analysis turns out that there is 1$\sigma$
significant level.


Back in 2011, one of the most efficient
space-based CR detector was launched by the arriage of Endeavor
space shuttle. The detecor has been attached into the international 
space station (ISS). The main mission of AMS-02 is to search an 
antimatter, dark matter from measuring CRs. It has capability to
detect an antimatter such as position and antiproton. This detector
is also able to detect other heavy weight nuclei like B, CNO,
Ne and etc. In 2015, a proton spectrum has been directly
reported and found the breaking at 340 GV (\cite{AMS02pr2015})
with a very high statistics. Not only the proton but the helium spectrum
is also measured and reported in \cite{Heliumflux2015}. 



% Turning back to the main objective of this work. The core concept 
% is to indirectly measure the proton CR spectrum 
According to the previous study (\cite{FermiEarth14}), 
low statistical significant potentially came from lack of the 
dataset or the methodology from the consequence of indirect
measurement. In this work, the similar study will be performed with 
a larger data size from $\sim$ 9 years of observation. Hopefully, 
the study could answer the first mentioned clue and to put the weights
on previous work. Moreover, an improvement of the optimization
process by employing the heuristic optimization as well as the
high performance calculation of the exposure map for a leser
computational time in $\gamma$-ray spectrum calculation.
