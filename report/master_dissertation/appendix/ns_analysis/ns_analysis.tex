\chapter{Analysis of $\gamma$-ray from North and South Directions}
\label{appendix:ns_analysis}


According to photon intensity in Earth's centered coordinates
shows the higher density in the North-South direction comparing 
the East-West direction (Figure \ref{fig:flxmap_polar}).
The clue might come from exposure time in the North and South direction
is much higher than the east and west in Figure \ref{fig:expmap_polar}.
Performing an analysis of the North-South's $\gamma$-ray spectrum 
to compare with the full limb's photon could be a good option for 
investigating the quality of the analysis.

The North-South spectrum is obtained by applying condition of 
$\phi_\text{NADIR} \in (-30^{\circ}, 30^{\circ})$ for collecting
spectrum from the North and the $\phi_\text{NADIR} \in (150^{\circ}, 210^{\circ})$
for accumulating the spectrum from the South. The $\gamma$-ray
spectrum is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ns_fit_gamma} on par with 
the optimization results from both SPL and BPL models.

Table \ref{tb:bestfit_ns} shows the fitted parameters from
particle swarm optimization and the scaled results of modeled
proton spectrum is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:ns_vsother}.
According to Table \ref{tb:bestfit}, the outcome from this analysis 
shows the consistency where it aligns within 1$\sigma$ of the deviation.
