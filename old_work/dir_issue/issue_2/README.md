# Issue
* [true] Find the week FT2 that phi_rock < 52 => N_cutted in each bin would be empty
* [ ] week 385 has a photon that photon 'TIME' > FT2 time 'STOP' of spacecraft in this week
<!-- * [ ] Pick a week that livetime_cut_week/livetime_week ~ 0.1 or 0.05 => we suppose to get N_cutted_week/N_week ~ 0.05 : But we got ~ (25/3)/(5000/300) ~ 0.5 not 0.05 !!! (should same week) -->
* [ ] To verify that fraction N (cut : ThetaNadir(66-70) && thetaRock(>52) && thetaLAT(<70) )/ N ( cut : thetaLAT(<70) ) in three week would same as fraction t (thetaROCK > 52)/t (this week) ~ 0.05
* From previous bullet, (1) got Nlimb/Nusual = 450/2668 (Week 280) (2) = 193/2503 (Week 362) (3) 186/199 (week 54)
